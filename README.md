# smart-grid-blockchaine
In this project we proposed an architecture and a energy data protection framework by combining blockchain technology and a
deep learning technique by describing the operating principles of the two methods and a collaboration to strengthen the data 
security of the modern electrical system against FDIA attack and energy theft

Implementation tools:
    - python 
    - TensorFlow
    - Pandas
    - Scikit-learn
    - Ganache gui : is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development used to deploy contracts, develop applications and run tests
               link : https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
    - Brownie : Brownie est un framework bas√© sur python pour les contrats intelligents ciblant la machine virtuelle Ethereum
               link : https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/toctree.html

The CNN model designed can detect the theft of energy at 99% and on the other hand, the blockchain makes it possible  to overcome the attack FDIA.

This project was an end-of-study project for obtaining a master's degree, for more details please see the pdf file ssi_i_001_2022.pdf
